## About

A Computer Science graduate, orginally from rural [North Kanara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttara_Kannada), India.

Broadly, my interests revolve around systems, languages and tools.

I consider myself a generalist, having dabbled in many areas of computer science, from containers to compilers.
